            <p>
                A cultivator is a significant agriculture machine in India, assisting in mixing soil around plants without hurting them. Cultivators play a critical part in preparing the soil by infusing it with nutrients and destroying weeds. As a result, it ensures ideal conditions for crop growth. In the 1900s, machines with tractor power and rows were created to replace horses. The cultivator machine could do the same work as various row planters.
